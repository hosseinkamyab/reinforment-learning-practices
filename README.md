# ðŸ¤– Hugging Face Deep Reinforcement Learning â€“ Practice Repo

This repository contains my hands-on work, notes, and experiments as I follow the [Hugging Face Deep RL Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/). It's a learning sandbox where I apply concepts like training agents, using environments, and leveraging the ðŸ¤— ecosystem.

## ðŸ“š Course Focus

- Deep Reinforcement Learning fundamentals
- Popular RL algorithms (DQN, PPO, A2C, etc.)
- Using `stable-baselines3` with custom and Gym environments
- Integration with ðŸ¤— Hub for sharing models and results
